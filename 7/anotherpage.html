    <h1>THE CONCEPTS OF SYSTEM</h1>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The system concept of MIS is, therefore one of optimizing the output of the organization 
        by connecting the operating subsystems through the medium of information exchange. 
        The Management information system (MIS) is a concept of the last two decade or two. 
        It has been understood and described in a number of ways. 
        It is also known as the Information System, the Information and Decision System, 
        the computer based Decision System. Information is the life blood of an organization, 
        particularly in the case of system approach management. The MIS or Information system 
        can be define as the knowledge communicated by others or obtained from investigation or study.
